# PintOSprojects

This repository contains source codes of mine for all the five pintOS projects, taken in 'Sogang Operating Systems (CSE4070)' in the second semester, 2022.

I got **perfect scores for all the project phases**, without any deduction of points.

Even though I gave so much effort to do and perfect these projects, there can be some mistakes. However, I can still guarantee you guys, that this repository gives you one of the best solution for sogang operating systems projects.

*If you, the reader is a student who takes the same course and have to do the same pintOS assignments, do the projects only with your own programming skills as much as possible. But even though you do the best, there may(must) be some hard troubles, and at that time you encounter those troubles, then reference these codes actively!*

But you know, **DO NOT JUST COPY these codes. You can refer to the code to help yourself do the homework efficiently, but do not just copying at all. It must be detected via copy detector**. (it really happened before!!)
